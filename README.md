Hanging lamps are a subtle and elegant way to add charm to your home for Navratri. They radiate a calming light that’s perfect for setting a spiritual tone around your puja space. You can place these near the mandir or along your entrance to welcome positivity. If you want a cozy nook for evening aartis, add a **[dori chair](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/dori-stool-combo-2?variant=50445566968113)** next to the **[light lamp](https://threadvibeliving.com/collections/lamps)** — it doubles as a low seat and an aesthetic touch.
